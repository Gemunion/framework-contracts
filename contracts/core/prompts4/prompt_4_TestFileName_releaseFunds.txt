ensure full correctness of this given test script 

in accordance with original smart contract it must have a full coverage of this single method

every reverting test case must be in format named like "should fail: (here is a actual named error)"

can use import { formatEther, ZeroAddress } from "ethers"; and etc directly - but never use ethers.utils or ethers.constants or AddressZero or etc

just respond with complete improved test case

$ cat /Users/gur/Documents/gemunion/framework-contracts/contracts/core/contracts/Mechanics/Lottery/LotteryRandom.sol
```

releaseFunds.ts
```
$ cat /Users/gur/Documents/gemunion/framework-contracts/contracts/core/test/Mechanics/LotteryRandom/shared/releaseFunds.ts
